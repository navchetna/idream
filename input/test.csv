"Class 6-8","Introduction to Living Things Plants Animals Human Body","What are living things? List some characteristics.","Living things are organisms that show signs of life. Characteristics include: growth reproduction respiration nutrition (need food) excretion (get rid of waste) response to stimuli (sensitivity) and movement."
"Class 9-10","Cell Biology Tissues Diversity Health Life Processes Genetics Intro","Describe the structure of a typical plant cell. Mention key organelles.","A plant cell typically has a cell wall (outermost layer provides rigidity) cell membrane cytoplasm a large central vacuole (stores water maintains turgor) nucleus (contains genetic material) chloroplasts (site of photosynthesis) mitochondria (site of respiration) ribosomes ER Golgi apparatus."
"Class 11-12","Detailed Physiology Genetics Evolution Ecology Biotechnology","Describe the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane.","Proposed by Singer and Nicolson this model describes the plasma membrane as a fluid structure where proteins are embedded or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. Lipids and some proteins can move laterally hence 'fluid mosaic'."
