Thermoplastics soften on heating and harden on cooling and can be remoulded (e.g. Polythene PVC). Thermosetting polymers become hard and infusible on heating and cannot be remoulded (e.g. Bakelite Melamine)."
"Class 11-12","Advanced Concepts Physical Organic Inorganic","Give examples of natural and synthetic polymers.","Natural polymers: Proteins (e.g. silk wool) Cellulose (e.g. cotton wood) Starch Natural rubber. Synthetic polymers: Polythene Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Nylon Polyester (Terylene) Bakelite Synthetic rubber (Buna-S)."
"Class 11-12","Advanced Concepts Physical Organic Inorganic","What are carbohydrates? Classify them with examples.","Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or substances that yield these on hydrolysis. Classification: Monosaccharides (simple sugars cannot be hydrolysed further e.g. Glucose Fructose) Oligosaccharides (yield 2-10 monosaccharide units on hydrolysis e.g. Sucrose Lactose) Polysaccharides (yield many monosaccharide units e.g. Starch Cellulose)."
"Class 11-12","Advanced Concepts Physical Organic Inorganic","Name some common drugs and classify them (e.g. antacids analgesics).","Common drug classes include: Antacids (neutralize stomach acid e.g. Magnesium hydroxide) Analgesics (reduce pain e.g. Aspirin Paracetamol) Antipyretics (reduce fever e.g. Paracetamol) Antibiotics (kill or inhibit bacteria e.g. Penicillin) Antiseptics (applied to living tissues to kill microbes e.g. Dettol) Disinfectants (applied to inanimate objects to kill microbes e.g. Phenol solutions) Tranquilizers (reduce stress/anxiety)."
