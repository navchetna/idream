Explain double fertilization in angiosperms (flowering plants).,Double fertilization is unique to angiosperms. One male gamete fuses with the egg cell to form the diploid zygote (develops into embryo). The second male gamete fuses with the central cell (containing two polar nuclei) to form the triploid primary endosperm nucleus (PEN) which develops into the endosperm (nutritive tissue).," Double fertilization is a type of fertilization in angiosperms (flowering plants) in which two male gametes fuse with two female gametes to form a zygote. In angiosperms, the male gametes are produced by the anther of the flower, while the female gametes are produced by the stigma of the flower.

What is Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment?,During gamete formation the segregation of alleles for one trait is independent of the segregation of alleles for another trait (provided the genes are on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome).," Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment states that the traits of two or more unlinked genes are independent of each other. This means that the occurrence of one trait does not affect the probability of occurrence of another trait.

What is cancer? What are carcinogens?,Cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division leading to the formation of tumors that can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. Carcinogens are agents that can cause cancer (e.g. tobacco smoke UV radiation certain chemicals viruses).," Explain the role of carcinogens in the development of cancer? Carcinogens are substances that, when introduced into the body, can cause cancer. These substances can be chemicals, radiation, or other forms of energy. The role of carcinogens in the development of cancer is to cause mutations in the DNA of cells, leading to uncontrolled cell division and the formation of tumors. In other words, carcinogens are the ""cancer-causing"" agents. The development of cancer is a complex process involving",0.57
What is AIDS? What causes it? How is it transmitted?,AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a chronic potentially life-threatening condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV damages the immune system making the body vulnerable to infections and cancers. Transmission occurs through: sexual contact sharing needles contaminated blood transfusions from infected mother to child during pregnancy/birth/breastfeeding., What are the symptoms of AIDS? What is the treatment for AIDS? (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A (HIV) (AIDS) - A,0.43
Differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.,Benign tumors are non-cancerous grow slowly remain localized (do not invade surrounding tissues or spread) and are usually less harmful. Malignant tumors are cancerous grow rapidly invade nearby tissues and can metastasize (spread) to distant parts of the body via blood or lymph making them dangerous.,", The best answer is: Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths that do not invade surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand, are cancerous growths that invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body., The best answer is: Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths that do not invade surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Malignant tumors, on the other hand,",0.88
What are antibiotics? Why should they be used judiciously?,Antibiotics are drugs used to treat bacterial infections by killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth. They should be used judiciously (only when prescribed complete the full course) because overuse or misuse can lead to antibiotic resistance where bacteria evolve to become resistant to the drugs making infections harder to treat. Antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections like the common cold or flu.," Antibiotics are substances that inhibit the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. They are used to treat bacterial infections and diseases. Antibiotics should be used judiciously because they can have harmful side effects, and their overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance, making infections harder to treat. Antibiotics should be used judiciously because they can have harmful side effects, and their overuse can lead to antibiotic resistance, making infections harder to treat. Antibiotics are",0.84
