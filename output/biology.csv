What is immunity? What are vaccines?,Immunity is the body's ability to resist infection and disease. Vaccines contain weakened or inactive pathogens (or their components) that stimulate the immune system to develop immunity against a specific disease without causing the illness itself.,"Here's a concise answer:

**Immunity:** Immunity is the body's natural defense against infectious diseases, where it produces antibodies to fight off pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms.

**Vaccines:** Vaccines are substances (like killed or attenuated pathogens, or weakened viruses) that stimulate the body's immune response, producing antibodies and activating immune cells to fight off specific diseases, thereby providing immunity.","Immunity refers to the body's ability to recognize and defend against pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. It involves various mechanisms like antibodies and immune cells that work together to fight off infections.

Vaccines are biological preparations that mimic an infection but are usually much less harmful than the actual disease-causing agent. They introduce weakened or inactivated pathogens into the body, triggering an immune response without causing the disease. This helps the body build up defenses against future infections by similar pathogens.",Immunity is the body's ability to resist infection or the harmful effects of toxins or pathogens.

Describe the process of nutrition in Amoeba.,Amoeba uses pseudopodia (false feet) to engulf food particles (phagocytosis) forming a food vacuole. Enzymes digest the food inside the vacuole. Absorbed nutrients diffuse into the cytoplasm. Undigested waste is expelled by exocytosis.,"In amoebas, nutrition is a passive process. The food source (e.g., bacteria, dead cells) is engulfed by the amoeba's pseudopodia, and the nutrients are absorbed into the cell. The nutrients are then used to synthesize energy (ATP) and build up the cell's components. This process is called phagocytosis.","Amoebas obtain nutrients through phagocytosis, where they engulf food particles using their pseudopodia. This process involves extending temporary projections (pseudopodia) around the food particle, which then pinch off to form a food vacuole containing the ingested material. The food vacuole fuses with the cell's digestive organelles, such as contractile vacuoles and food vacuoles, where enzymes break down the nutrients into simpler forms that can be absorbed","Amoeba engulfs food particles through phagocytosis, forming a food vacuole where digestion occurs intracellularly.",0.7,0.82,0.74

Explain Mendel's Law of Dominance.,When parents with pure contrasting traits are crossed only one form of the trait (the dominant trait) appears in the next generation (F1). The other form (recessive trait) is masked.,"Mendel's Law of Dominance states that each pair of alleles (different forms of a gene) will express itself in a ratio of 1:1, i.e., one allele will be expressed and the other will be masked. This law explains how a single gene can have two different alleles and still produce a single phenotype.","Mendel's Law of Dominance states that when two alleles for a trait exist in a heterozygous organism (one allele from each parent), the dominant allele will be expressed, while the recessive allele will not. In other words, if a dominant allele is present, it masks the effect of the recessive allele, even though the recessive allele may still be present in the genotype.","Mendel's Law of Dominance states that in a heterozygous pair of alleles, one allele (the dominant one) will mask the expression of the other allele (the recessive one), determining the organism's phenotype.",0.39,0.48,0.44

This means that each gene on a chromosome separates into two identical alleles, one from each homologous chromosome. This law explains the inheritance pattern in plants and animals, where each gene is paired with another identical copy, and only one allele is expressed in the offspring.","Mendel's Law of Segregation states that during the formation of gametes (reproductive cells), the two alleles for a heritable trait segregate so that each gamete receives only one allele for that trait. This means that when an organism produces gametes, the two alleles for a gene separate or segregate from each other, ensuring that each gamete receives only one allele for that gene. This law explains why offspring inherit one allele from each parent for a given trait.","Mendel's Law of Segregation states that during the formation of gametes, the two alleles for a trait separate (segregate) so that each gamete carries only one allele for each trait.",0.48,0.77,0.78

They work by lowering the activation energy of the reaction. Each enzyme has an active site specific to its substrate(s).,"Enzymes are biological molecules, typically proteins, that significantly speed up the rate of chemical reactions in living organisms.

- Binding to the substrate (the substance being acted upon)
- Lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur

Describe the mechanism of muscle contraction (Sliding Filament Theory).,Muscle contraction occurs when thin filaments (actin) slide past thick filaments (myosin) within the sarcomeres of muscle fibers. This sliding is powered by ATP hydrolysis and involves the formation and breaking of cross-bridges between myosin heads and actin filaments. Calcium ions play a key role in initiating the process.,"The Sliding Filament Theory (SFT) explains muscle contraction as follows:

1. **Actin and Myosin Filaments**: Muscle fibers have actin filaments (thin) and myosin filaments (thicker). These filaments are in a relaxed, parallel arrangement.

2. **Muscle Stimulation**: When a muscle is stimulated (e.g., by a nerve impulse), the actin filaments contract and become more compact.

3. **Cross-Striction**:","The Sliding Filament Theory describes how muscles contract. It involves two types of filaments within the muscle fibers: thick filaments (formed mainly by myosin) and thin filaments (formed mainly by actin). When an action potential reaches the muscle cell, it triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This increase in calcium causes the thin filaments to bind to the myosin heads through regulatory proteins like tropomyosin and troponin","Muscle contraction occurs through the sliding filament theory, where actin filaments slide over myosin filaments, powered by ATP hydrolysis, causing the sarcomere to shorten and generate force.",0.71,0.82,0.87

Explain the transmission of a nerve impulse across a synapse.,When a nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal (presynaptic neuron) it triggers the release of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) into the synaptic cleft (gap). These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron causing an electrical signal (impulse) to be generated in it.,"At the end of the neuron, neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin) are released into the synapse. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the surface of adjacent neurons, triggering a rapid depolarization. This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium ions to flood in and trigger further depolarization. The depolarization is then terminated by the opening of potassium channels, allowing potassium ions to flood out and repolarize the neuron.","A nerve impulse is transmitted across a synapse through the following steps:

1. **Action Potential Arrival:** The action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal at the end of an axon.

2. **Opening of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels:** The arrival of the action potential causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic membrane to open, allowing calcium ions (Ca²⁺) to enter the synaptic terminal.

Explain biomagnification with an example.,Biomagnification (or bioamplification) is the increasing concentration of a substance (like pesticides or heavy metals) in the tissues of organisms at successively higher levels in a food chain. Example: DDT accumulating in aquatic food chains reaching high levels in fish-eating birds causing eggshell thinning.,"Biomagnification: It's the increase in concentration of a substance (like mercury, lead, or pesticides) in a food chain, starting from the base of the food chain.

Example: 

- Small fish (e.g., sardines) eat algae and plankton, which have low levels of mercury.
- Small fish eat small fish, which have higher levels of mercury.
- Large fish (e.g., sharks) eat smaller fish, which have higher levels of mercury.
- Large","Biomagnification is the process where the concentration of a pollutant increases at each level of a food chain as organisms are eaten. This occurs because pollutants like heavy metals or certain organic compounds are not easily excreted from organisms, leading to their accumulation in tissues over time.
