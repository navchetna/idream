Here are some key characteristics of living things:

1. **Metabolism**: Living things can take in nutrients and energy to sustain their life processes. This includes the breakdown of food (catabolism) and the synthesis of new molecules (anabolism).

2. **Homeostasis**: Living things maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in their external environment. This involves regulating temperature, pH levels","Living things are characterized by the following essential features:

- Move
- Eat
- Grow
- Breathe
- Excrete
- Respond to stimuli
- Reproduce
- Die

Plants show growth in Activity 10.2, and another characteristic clearly in plants is movement (e.g., opening and closing of leaves).","Living things, also known as organisms, are entities that exhibit the characteristics of life. These characteristics distinguish living things from non-living matter. Here are some key characteristics of living things:

1. Organization: Living organisms are highly organized, with cells as the basic unit of life. These cells are specialized and work together to form tissues, organs, and organ systems.

2. Metabolism: Living things undergo metabolic processes,","Living things are entities that exhibit several distinct characteristics which set them apart from non-living things. These characteristics include:

1. Movement: Living beings have the ability to move, either internally (like the movement of blood in animals) or externally (like the growth of roots in plants).

2. Eating: They consume nutrients and energy to maintain their bodily functions and support growth.

3. Growth: Living beings under",0.89,0.44,0.89,0.84,0.88,0.88
Describe the structure of a typical plant cell. Mention key organelles.,A plant cell typically has a cell wall (outermost layer provides rigidity) cell membrane cytoplasm a large central vacuole (stores water maintains turgor) nucleus (contains genetic material) chloroplasts (site of photosynthesis) mitochondria (site of respiration) ribosomes ER Golgi apparatus.,"I'd be happy to help!

A typical plant cell has a structure that can be divided into several organelles, each with a specific function. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

Describe the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane.,Proposed by Singer and Nicolson this model describes the plasma membrane as a fluid structure where proteins are embedded or attached to a double layer (bilayer) of phospholipids. Lipids and some proteins can move laterally hence 'fluid mosaic'.,"The fluid mosaic model (FMM) is a widely accepted theory that describes the structure of the plasma membrane, which is the thin layer of lipid and protein molecules that surrounds and separates the cell's contents from the external environment.

Phosphol","The fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, proposed by Singer and Nicolson in 1972, describes the plasma membrane as a fluid layer composed primarily of a phospholipid bilayer. Embedded within or attached to this bilayer are various proteins that can move laterally within the membrane. This arrangement allows for flexibility and dynamic changes in the membrane's composition and function. The plasma membrane is selectively permeable, meaning it controls what substances can enter or leave the cell, and it interacts","The fluid mosaic model is a conceptual representation of the plasma membrane's structure, proposed by S.J.
